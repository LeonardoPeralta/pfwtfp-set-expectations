# Set Expectations

## Learning Goals

- Identify a programmatical problem solving process
- Prepare to program with the Flatiron Process

## Introduction

Before we learn how to program, we really need to learn how solve problems. Programming, after all, is a process of solving problems with code. The better we can think through problems and brainstorm solutions, the better programmers we'll be.

### Identify a Programmatical Problem Solving Process

- Understand the problem or question at hand
  - Have we read it thoroughly? Do we have all the context/information we need?
  - What is the true goal here?
  - How do we separate concerns so that we focus on one problem/question at a time?

- Create a plan
  - Determine what steps are necessary to reach the goal you identified earlier
  - Prioritize problems and sub-problems so that you're not doing everything at once

- Implement your solution
  - Test and gather feedback for revisions

### Prepare to Program with the Flatiron Process

- Describe how a general problem solving process provides a foundation for learning more specific Flatiron strategies

## Conclusion

By learning how to think more generally like a programmer, we will understand more about how to break down and solve problems in code. We will also be prepared to dive into the Flatiron strategies for producing solid code.
